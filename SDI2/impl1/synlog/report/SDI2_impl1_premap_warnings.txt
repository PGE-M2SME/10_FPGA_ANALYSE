@W: MT529 :"/home/diamond/SharedFolder/SDI2/PCS_IP.vhd":2884:5:2884:6|Found inferred clock PLL_IP|CLKOP_inferred_clock which controls 1 sequential elements including PCS.refclkdiv2_rx_ch3. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
